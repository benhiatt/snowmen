# "Doom: Attack of the Killer Snowmen"
This is hopefully the start of a group effort at making a 3D game comparable to Doom without using an engine.

## Brainstorming
Primary weapon is a hair dryer instead of a gun, to melt snowmen.

Snowmen throw snowballs.

Snowmen drop carrots on defeat, to be eaten to restore health.

Snowmen drop sticks, for building campfires.
